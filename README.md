# external-oss-builds
This repository contains some Jenkinsfile and other stuff to build opensource projects who use Jetty

The idea is to be able to to build those projects with a staged release of Jetty or snapshot builds to test we are backward compatible

- `Jenkinsfile.airlift` build Airlift project https://github.com/airlift/airlift with jetty project as parameter
